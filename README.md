## Improves Team Collaboration:
 - Milestones and issues provide a clear way to communicate project goals and tasks. Team members can easily track progress, assign responsibilities, and collaborate efficiently.

## Organizes Workflow:
- Project boards help visualize the projectâ€™s status, making it easy to manage tasks and ensure deadlines are met. This structure keeps the team on track and reduces confusion.

## Challenges in Adoption:
- New team members may face a learning curve when using GitHub's tools. Consistently updating the board and issues can also feel time-consuming at first, but it becomes easier with practice.
